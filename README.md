<!-- <h2>Landing Page</h2> -->
The landing page displays a list of items available for purchase. Each item has a name, description, and price. Users can add items to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button. The number of items in the cart is displayed on the cart icon at the top of the page. The data of items in the cart is stored in local storage.

<!-- <h2>Cart Page</h2> -->
The cart page displays a list of items that the user has added to their cart. The items are displayed in a top-down fashion, along with the item name, description, quantity, and price. Additionally, the cart page displays the total price of all items, the discounted 10% price, and the final payable price.

Users can click the "Place Order" button to proceed to the payment gateway page.

<!-- <h2>Payment Gateway Page</h2> -->
The payment gateway page allows users to enter their card details, including card number, expiry date, CVV number, and password. After entering the required information, users can click the "Pay Now" button to complete their purchase.
